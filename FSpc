# Requirement Specification

# Overview
We are making mobile application for fastfood chains in Android and IOS. 
The main function of the program is to give loyal customers unique discounts at the restaurant headquarters, which can be enforced at any of their locations, but only once per person. These offers will be activated by a user-level IT professional.

# Current situation
Currently, no similar system is working. The shopper goes into one of the chain stores, chooses the menu, pays and leaves.
