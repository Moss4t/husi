# 9. Use Cases

Customer Interface: Optional: Sign In / Sign Out OR Sign Up -> Select Coupon -> Discount Details -> Coupon Valid -> Used Coupon Disappears

HR Interface: Sign In / Sign Out -> Add New Coupon (Description of Discount, Expiration Date) / Cancel Coupon / View Statistics (Monthly / Yearly View, Coupon Popularity)

Fortunately, HR has some knowledge of how to use a computer, but we won't overwork the web for ease of use.

To use the web interface, you need to log in to the HR female, whom I will call Jucus. Only Jucus, his deputy in his absence, can use the system.

On this page you can create new coupons, add them to existing coupons, remove existing coupons from the list. You can perform these functions on the page that appears after login by selecting the appropriate menu items.

By clicking on the Create New Coupon menu item, Jucus can provide information about the new coupon, for example: an illustration illustrating the thing we get a discount on the coupon, a date before the coupon can be used, the amount of the discount.

By clicking on "Delete Coupon", Jucus will be able to delete the coupon from the current coupon.

From this web interface, you can view Jucus statistics on the use of the application by clicking on the statistics menu item.

After launching the mobile application, our little user will immediately be confronted with the currently available coupons, which have a graphic illustration, a text description that includes the discount rate, a code that the seller reads when using the coupon.

On this page of the application you can also view coupons that have expired.


# 10. Scenario

- The coupon will be uploaded.
- Validate the coupon.
- The popularity of the coupon is increasing and it is included in the monthly statistics.
- The used coupon will be deleted from the account / device.
- Expired coupons are automatically deleted everywhere.
