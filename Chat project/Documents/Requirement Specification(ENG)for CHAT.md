# Requirement specification

This requirement specification is the result of a report with the CEO and needs further clarification.


# 1. Overview

We create a chat program for students, specifically to discuss school-related topics.
They can talk about their homework, they can help each other understand and complement what they learned at school.
Login is required to use this program.
There is no possibility to attach files, it is mainly for text messages.


# 2. Current situation

Currently the students use different chat applications (e.g. messenger), there is no uniformly used application.
Students use the same application for private discussions, school assignments, different projects,
which makes the different informations less transparent.


# 3. Target

The new application would be the scene of school-related communication.
Students can share information about their studies in one place.
Because this is a separate interface specifically designed for school assignments,
it becomes more transparent so other factors do not interfere with the conversation, therefore there is no need to search back for informations.
For the students, using the program would be closely linked to their studies.
Login is required to use this program.

- year CXII. Law on Freedom of Information and Freedom of Information Act (Infotv.)


# 5. Model of current business processes

Students use the same interface for almost every area of their lives,
therefoe searching back on the chat and filtering out irrelevant information makes it harder for students
to discuss and review things which are specifically school-related.


# 6. Modell of requested business process

The new interface displays information closely related to students' studies, without distractions.
