--- They would be separated on separate topics. Tree-like category division. For example, a school, including classes, X teams. There could be more classes, there could be more small groups .---

[User] -> (puts people in groups) [User] -> (creates job help tables) -> (divides processes between users) -> (adds deadlines for tasks) -> (adds detailed description)
--- You can also assign powers to use. For example, to delete people from a group, only the teacher should have the opportunity, but everyone should have the right to assign tasks. The latter would include an informative message about what happened .---
