# Functional Specification

This riport was made with the members, and needs more details.


# 1. Overveiw

To eliminate the chaos caused by current chat programs, we offer a solution for unifying communication. We offer to access learning things without distractions. No distractions / disturbing things such as ads, gifs, stickers, and kitsch things. Of course, we would add color to our program by avoiding monotony and a gray environment.

# 2. Present Situation

There is no similar system to ours. The current ones are not used for learning, just for fun. It's a system, that makes the connection useless, because it's disturbing, and unusable to learn from afar. It doesn't make the right connection, for study purposes. 

# 3. Target System

Our target is to create a unique and useful program. Which creates a social network, because it's special, and usable. What we want is, to fit the students needs, get positive feedback, building critics, and customisable application.
